# BUGATTI Project Website


This repository hosts the static website for the BUGATTI (Building security Guidance, Applying pracTical Threat modellIng) project — a Vlaio/COOCK tech transfer project led by KU Leuven's DistriNet research group.

🌐 **Live Site:** [https://ku-leuven-msec.github.io/bugatti](https://ku-leuven-msec.github.io/bugatti)

## About the Project

BUGATTI bridges the gap between academic security research and practical industry applications, focusing on:
- Practical threat modeling methodologies
- Actionable security guidance
- Industry collaboration and knowledge transfer
- Dissemination of research findings


## Website Structure & Features

The website is built with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, using custom SCSS and layouts for a modern, professional look. Key sections include:

- **Home** (`index.md`): Project overview and objectives
- **Knowledge Dissemination** (`knowledge-dissemination.md`): Events, workshops, and knowledge sharing
- **Blog** (`blog.md`): In-depth articles and insights
- **Presentations** (`presentations.md`): Meeting presentations and materials (PDFs in `assets/presentations/`)
- **Consortium** (`consortium.md`): Research partners, contact info, and funding

Other features:
- Modern favicon and browser icon support (SVG, PNG, ICO, Apple touch)
- Email addresses are obfuscated for privacy
- Responsive, visually improved footer and hero sections

## Updating the Website

### Adding New Pages

Create a new markdown file with front matter:

```yaml
---
layout: page
title: "Page Title"
permalink: /page-url/
---

# Content here
```

Add to navigation in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
header_pages:
  - index.md
  - presentations.md
  - new-page.md
```
