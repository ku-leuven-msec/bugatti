# BUGATTI - Embedded Security Testing and Automation

## General Objective

Enhancing the security of IoT and embedded solutions through the use of advanced security testing and automation techniques.

## About the Project

The Internet of Things (IoT) has fundamentally changed our interaction with technology, permeating all levels of society, from consumer to industry. The increased connectivity offers unprecedented opportunities; in business environments, industrial IoT optimizes productivity, efficiency, and profitability. At the same time, it brings significant security challenges. It is essential to secure IoT devices and their infrastructures to ensure data integrity, privacy, and operational continuity. 

Unfortunately, too many IoT developers still view security as a cost item, resulting in this aspect being neglected. However, there is growing concern about the impact of upcoming regulations, and a lack of expertise to adequately address security. Solving these problems is far from simple due to the high degree of complexity and diversity in IoT. This complexity applies even compared to the security of cloud and web-based digital systems, for which solutions are already available for non-research-intensive companies.

This project focuses on making advanced security testing tools and methods accessible to companies and industries developing IoT and embedded solutions. Additionally, it provides robust tools for the secure configuration, deployment, and management of IoT solutions, ensuring sustainable security for the future. This will strengthen the overall cybersecurity of IoT solutions and enable companies to develop robust and secure IoT applications that meet the highest security standards. This is crucial for a solid cybersecurity strategy.

### Target Audience

The project's target audience includes:
- Companies and industries involved in developing IoT solutions
- Organizations developing embedded software
- Security professionals and consultants responsible for testing and securing IoT solutions
- Integrators and developers of associated digital solutions

### Strategic Value

To increase the competitiveness of Flemish companies, the project aims to enable them to develop more secure IoT solutions. It stimulates innovation and strengthens their market position within and outside the European Union. This is crucial in light of upcoming European regulations, such as the **Red Delegated Act (2025)** and the **Cyber Resilience Act (2027)**, which impose strict security requirements on digital products.

Rapid absorption of results is expected and urgent in light of emerging regulations. Adoption directly results in more secure IoT solutions and compliance with legislation and standards. To maximize the dissemination and accessibility of this project's results, hands-on tutorials and workshops are being developed. These educational resources provide practical knowledge and skills, better equipping companies to integrate advanced security tools into their processes.

## Project Objectives

The project aims to enhance the security of IoT and embedded solutions through the use of advanced security testing and automation techniques. While existing solutions primarily focus on finding vulnerabilities in specific scenarios such as errors in a web API or in the protocol stack of an application, we find that IoT solutions form a very different playing field. IoT solutions are very diverse and each solution is different. From hardware to operating systems and communication protocols, each aspect brings its own security challenges. Therefore, a one-size-fits-all solution is not realistic. 

Specifically, we establish the following project objectives:

1. **Insight into Security Vulnerabilities**: Building expertise and maturity in identifying where and which vulnerabilities can occur in a specific IoT ecosystem.

2. **Effective Integration of Security Tools**: Enabling effective implementation of customized security tools in IoT environments through guidelines and best practices, which are also incorporated into hands-on tutorials.

3. **Improved Security Analysis of IoT Applications**: Enhancing the security of IoT and embedded solutions through the use of advanced security testing and automation techniques. This will be measured using metrics such as coverage to gain insight into which vulnerabilities are detected, but also the blind spots.

4. **Secure Configuration, Deployment and Management of IoT Applications via Automation**: Making the use of IoT in complex solutions manageable through deployment and security control of Infrastructure-as-Code, and security management through the detection, orchestration and handling of incidents in IoT environments.

5. **Compliance with Regulations and Standards**: Providing companies with the knowledge and resources to achieve compliance with regulations and standards. We will at least test the provided tools and technologies against the RED-DA and CRA regulations, and treat the IEC 62443-4.x standards and harmonized standard prEN 303 645.

6. **Dissemination of Knowledge and Best Practices**: Disseminating knowledge, guidelines and best practices for securing IoT solutions to the broader target audience.

## Project Scope

### Binary Analysis
At the most fundamental level, we focus on the analysis of compiled software, i.e., binaries. Vulnerabilities that were not caught during earlier steps in the development process (e.g., via source code analysis) can still be detected as much as possible at this stage. Especially with (unsafe) legacy code, this can be necessary.

### Device Security
At the device level, we concentrate on detecting vulnerabilities in IoT devices using pentests and thorough security analyses of firmware.

### Infrastructure for Secure Configuration and Management
The highest level encompasses the infrastructure for secure configuration, management, and orchestration of IoT solutions across various devices in the ecosystem.
